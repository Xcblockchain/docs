# XCapital: Ethereum â†” XCapital

XCapital native bridge between Ethereum and XCapital is used to relay the XCapital native token from XCapital to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The XCapital bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer XCapital tokens between the XCapital chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's XCapital or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of XCapital tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the XCapital chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on XCapital chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on XCapital chain, waiting for all bridge validators on XCapital chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## How to use

On XCapital you send native XCapital token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the XCapital token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the XCapital token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the XCapital native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
