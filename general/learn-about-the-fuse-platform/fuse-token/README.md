# XCapital Token (XCBC)

The XCBC token is the native currency of the XCapital blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## XCBC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the XCapital blockchain, XCBC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake XCapital to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 25k. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.xcscan.com/](https://status.xcscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked XCBC. Which means validators with higher amounts of XCapital staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any XCBC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of XCBC they wish. They receive a share of the XCapital block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As XCBC is the native currency on XCapital, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, XCBC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of XCBC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the XCapital platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
